# Houdini Engine for Maya
Houdini Engine for Maya is a Maya plug-in that allows deep integration of
Houdini technology into Autodesk Maya through the use of Houdini Engine.

This plug-in brings Houdini's powerful and flexible procedural workflow into
Maya through Houdini Digital Assets. Artists can interactively adjust the
asset's parameters inside Maya, and use Maya geometries as an asset's inputs.
Houdini's procedural engine will then "cook" the asset and the results will be
available right inside Maya.

The plug-in is currently released as a public preview. During the experimental
testing period, the Maya plug-in will be available freely to CG artists.

The easiest way for artists to access the plug-in is to download the latest
production build of Houdini or the [FREE Houdini Apprentice Learning
Edition](http://www.sidefx.com/index.php?option=com_download&task=apprentice&Itemid=208)
and install the Maya plug-in along with the Houdini interactive software.
Houdini Digital Assets created in either Houdini or Apprentice can then be
loaded into Maya through the plug-in. A growing library of Digital Assets for
use in Maya will be available at the [Orbolt Smart 3D Asset
Store](http://www.orbolt.com/maya).
